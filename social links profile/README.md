## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I am particularly happy about transitioning and hover in the html and css code. i leearnt it while i was building this project

For code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="section2">
  <div>
    <ul>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aishemporium"><button class="listing"><li >GitHub</li></button></a>
    </ul>
  </div>
 </section>
 ```
 ```css
.listing:hover{
    background: gray;
    color: black;
    cursor: pointer;
}

### Continued development
I hope going forward, i know more about css and html, then javascript.
